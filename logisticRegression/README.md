Welcome to the logistic regression file of the Tsmith319 Machine Learning library. To run this file you simply need to type in ./run_script.sh. 
The output will present the training and testing accuracy next to their respective variance except for the ML.py since variance isn't involved.
Please make note that these models aren't perfect and it is due to underfitting and converging too early, but I plan to continue to diagnose the 
problems until fixed.
