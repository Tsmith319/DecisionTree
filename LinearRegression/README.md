Welcome to the LinearRegression file for machine learning library. Within this file you will find various files that can be used for linear
regression application. The two files that implement linear regression algorithms is the gradientDescent.py and the stochasticGradientDescent.py.
Each python file will have a corresponding results file for examples of what the output will look like. For the gradientDescent.py, its corresponding
file is 4a_results and for stochasticGradientDescent.py it is the 4b_results. To run both files, simply run the command ./linear_script.sh.
The file will run very fast but make note that if you would like, you may change the r variable in either file to adjust the learning rate. As
well the output for the stochasticGradientDescent.py will have different outputs due to the fact it is grabbing random samples from the data set.
