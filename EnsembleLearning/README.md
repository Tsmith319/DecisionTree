Welcome to the EnsembleLearning file for the machine learning library. The library contains multiple files that contain algorithms for
creating calculating certain data that is used in ensemble learning. The files that are listed in this file are AdaBoost.py and its 
corresponding results in 2a_results text file, Bagging.py and its corresponding results in 2b_results, 100predictors.py and its 
corresponding results in 2c_results, random_tree.py for random forest algorithm and its corresponding results in 2d_results, and finally
randoForestPredictors.py and its corresponding results in 2e_results. To run this code you simply use the command in the terminal
./ensemble_script.sh and it will run all of the python files. 
If you are curious of what an example of the output for the data may be please examine the corresponding results file for each python file.
